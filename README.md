# RedM Portfolio

Hello, I have been programming since 2013 and since 2018 in FiveM/RedM. Below are my skills and expertise:


## Server-side Scripting
* Discovering and fixing exploits (e.g. [#1](https://github.com/Gum-Core/gum_inventory/issues/2), [#2](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redemrp_inventory/issues/49), [#3](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redemrp_shops/issues/3), [#4](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redemrp_inventory/compare/main...draobrehtom:redemrp_inventory:main), [#5](https://github.com/Gum-Core/gum_inventory/compare/main...draobrehtom:gum_inventory:main), [#6](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/rsg-inventory/compare/main...draobrehtom:rsg-inventory:main)).
* Scripts Network Usage Optimization.
* Scripts Security.

## Client-side Scripting

* Using [Decompiled Native Scripts](https://github.com/stianhje/rdr3-decompiled-scripts) to discover unique game functionality (e.g. [#1](https://youtu.be/LAUTKr_9Geo?feature=shared&t=16)).
* Scripts CPU Usage Optimization (e.g. [#1](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-manual/debugging/using-profiler/)).

## Research

* Good knowledge of and [CodeX](https://discord.gg/codewalker) for researching in-game data (e.g. [#1](https://forum.cfx.re/t/how-to-add-a-new-custom-horse/5185418), [#2](https://forum.cfx.re/t/how-to-weapon-modifying/5245550))

## Custom Assets

* Basic knowledge of [Sollumz](https://github.com/ultrahacx/Sollumz-RDR) and Blender. Experience in collaborating with 3D modelers for more complex tasks (e.g. [#1](https://streamable.com/mlgh5m), [#2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoV39Hs5BFA)).


## Languages

* Lua/JS for scripting on client and server-side
* HTML and JS for UI creation
* Python for automatization of routine tasks
